Setting up React native:
This guide is following offical documentation:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Step 1. Creating your project
create your project with this command:
npx create-expo-app@latest
(you can open your terminal on vs code with ctrl + shift + `)
You will be prompted to install some packages and name our app
when setup is complete you will see this message
to begin on the next step cd the folder that was just made

cd yourprojectname

Step 2. Installing Packages
we will now use npm to install all the required packages
start by installing expo
npm install expo

once this is done lets install all the other packages (already listed out as dependinces in package.json)
npm install


Step 3. Confirming setup
run this command
npx expo start

this should start expo

in your terminal you will se a qr code, ip adress, and options for how to open your app
press w in your terminal 
this will open your browser and will give you basic infromation on react native


Step 4. Propperly running the app
the web view with local host may suffice for now, but it is not how you shoul be building your app
