Setting up React Native:
This guide has the following official documentation:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Step 1. Creating your project
Create your project with this command:
npx create-expo-app@latest

(You can open your terminal on VS Code with ctrl + shift + `)
You will be prompted to install some packages and name our app (name it To-do-app).
When the setup is complete, you will see this message.
To begin with the next step, cd the folder that was just made.
 cd .\To-do-app\ 

Step 2. Installing Packages
We will now use npm to install all the required packages.
Start by installing expo:
npm install expo

Once this is done, let's install all the other packages (already listed as dependencies in package.json).
Npm install


Step 3. Confirming setup
Run this command
Npx expo start

This should start with an expo.
In your terminal you will see a qr code, IP address, and options for how to open your app.
Press w in your terminal 
This will open your browser and will give you basic information on reacting native

Step 4. Properly running the app
The web view with a local host may suffice for now, but it is not how you should be building your app.
## I NEED SOMEONE TO DO THIS STEP. I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
# CREATE STEPS ON HOW TO INSTALL EXPO GO AND USE IT (VERY FAST)
# CREATE STEPS ON HOW TO INSTALL ANDROID STUDIO, EMULATE, ANDROID, AND RUN EXPO GO ON IT
    # I RECOMMEND WE JUST GIVE A YT VIDEO (WE ALSO NEED TO DO THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER SETUP BECAUSE OF HOW SLOW IT IS)
